# Git

> [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

I use [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) and [Git Kraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/) as my git client app.

You should read the git documentation [Pro Git](https://git-scm.com/doc).

## Commits

I try to use the [Angular conventions](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).

If you want to automate your commit style you can us the [commitlint](https://commitlint.js.org/#/).

### Type

Must be one of the following:

- `feat` – a new feature is introduced with the changes
- `fix` – a bug fix has occurred
- `chore` – changes that do not relate to a fix or feature and don't modify src or test files (for example updating dependencies)
- `refactor` – refactored code that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `docs` – updates to documentation such as a the README or other markdown files
- `style` – changes that do not affect the meaning of the code, likely related to code formatting such as white-space, missing semi-colons, and so on.
- `test` – including new or correcting previous tests
- `perf` – performance improvements
- `ci` – continuous integration related
- `build` – changes that affect the build system or external dependencies
- `revert` – reverts a previous commit

### Good Examples

- `feat: improve performance with lazy load implementation for images`
- `chore: update npm dependency to latest version`
- `Fix bug preventing users from submitting the subscribe form`
- `Update incorrect client phone number within footer body per client request`
