# Video Games
Here I try  to list all video games i played and the age. with all platforms.

I am most a PC gamer. But recently I started using a console Xbox one controller,  in computer and now the Nintendo switch pro. I find easy and more immersive that way.
## PC
Here the list is long. I started here and probably will die here. But i prefer to buy a good PC instead of PS or Xbox, make sense right.

### MMORPG
MMORPGA is just a big part of my life. I used to play a lot and make friends online. Some may say is just a big waste of time but i enjoyed and remember i had a great time.
