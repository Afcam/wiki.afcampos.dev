# [My Field Guide ðŸª„](https://wiki.afcampos.dev)

Welcome to my Field Guide, where I share what I've learned, along with a mix of useful links and random discoveries. This guide is a living repository of insights and knowledge, cultivated with care and shared with you.

Within these virtual pages, you'll stumble upon a delightful mishmash of articles, tips, and quirky creative projects that span an assortment of topics. From practical advice (or at least attempts at it) and resources to mind-bending musings, this guide aims to nurture an ecosystem of ideas and insights,

Feel free to wander through the pages, clicking on links that catch your interest, and exploring the random bits of knowledge I've gathered along the way. Let's embark on this field guide adventure, where we can learn, share, and discover together.

## Thank you
